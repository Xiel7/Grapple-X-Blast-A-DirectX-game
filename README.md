<h1>Overview</h1>
<h2>High Concept</h2>

GRAPPLE X BLAST. The two words combined two different interesting traversal methods- grappling on a point and swinging across and blasting yourself off in the air. This game is about a guy whose name is Guy Red who has two big guns in his arsenal which is the Grappling Gun and the Blast Cannon, both huge and menacing but luckily it is not pointed towards people. The big guns only serve a single purpose and that is to help him traverse in a labyrinth filled with traps and danger. Grappling Gun helps him soar the air like the friendly neighbourhood crawler that we always admire while Blast Cannon provides him with a way to jump high into air which resembles a certain character in the FPS genre. He must find his way out of the labyrinth by finding a certain key to unlock doors and gates to make his way out of the labyrinth. The game provides players with challenges such as ammo management and route planning with a spice of puzzle mechanics. If heâ€™s out of ammo and loses his way out, then he might as well be dead. Follow the journey of  Guy Red as he aims his way out the dangerous labyrinth with his strong and powerful arsenal of tools to help him traverse.
